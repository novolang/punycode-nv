# tests/alloc_scan.sh — nothing in `punyboot` allocates, as a check that
# can fail.
#
# `punyboot` is the module a device runs.  What makes it usable there is
# not that it avoids `Str`, which the type checker decides, but that it
# puts nothing on the heap.  The emitted LLVM is where that is true or
# false, so this reads it.
#
# There are three runs, because a check that cannot fail is not a check.
#
#   1. Every function in the module appears in the IR of
#      `tests/alloc_probe.nv` at `--opt=0`, and none of them calls the
#      allocator, directly or through a runtime entry point that
#      allocates on the caller's behalf.
#   2. The scan still sees an allocation.  A heap list literal is
#      spliced into `punyboot`'s `is_basic` on a copy of the tree, with
#      the module's `@tier(embedded)` annotations taken off so the
#      compiler is not what refuses it, and the scan has to name it.
#      Without this run, a scan that quietly stopped matching would
#      pass forever.
#   3. The compiler still refuses the same splice with
#      `@tier(embedded)` left on.  An annotation that stopped being
#      enforced looks exactly like one that passes.
#
# Run from anywhere:  bash tests/alloc_scan.sh
